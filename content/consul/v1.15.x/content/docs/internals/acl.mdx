page_title: ACL System
description: >-
  Consul provides an optional Access Control List (ACL) system which can be used
  to control access to data and APIs. The ACL system is a Capability-based
  system that relies on tokens which can have fine grained rules applied to
  them. It is very similar to AWS IAM in many ways.
