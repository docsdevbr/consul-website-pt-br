# Consul vs. Other Software

The problems Consul solves are varied, but each individual feature has been
solved by many different systems. Although there is no single system that
provides all the features of Consul, there are other options available to solve
some of these problems.

In this section, we compare Consul to some other options. In most cases, Consul
is not mutually exclusive with any other system.

Use the navigation to the left to read the comparison of Consul to specific
systems.
